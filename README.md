To practice all the HTML knowledge acquired thus far in The Odin Project
I am building a basic recipe website. 

This website will have:
A main index page
Links from index to a few recipes

The goal is not for it to look pretty but just to practice HTML.

This project will be revisited in the future once I have learned CSS.
